Seeed Unified Library Interface
------------------------------
#What is Suly

We have hundreds of sensors, actuators, displays and the other useful module. In the past time, we mainly focus on Arduino application, and we only supplied Arduino Library. So if you use an another platform such as Raspberry, LauchPad, or MCS51, you need to porting our Library, and sometimes it's not an easy work. 

Thus sometime we will get some trouble, some custom will ask us to supply some library for a non-Arduino platform, What we can do is telling them, hey man, we have Arduino library only. Every time I talk about this I feel shame. 

So, what I think is that if there's a way can make our libraries to fit all platform. Of curse we finally find it out, it's Suly - Seeed Unified Library Interface, which can make all of(at least 90%) our library fit many common platform, or at least make it easy to porting.
